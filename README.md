# SemanticSegmentation-CGMANet
This is the implementation of our work "Context Guided Multiscale Attention for Realtime Semantic Segmentation". 
The repository has three training scripts: use `train_enc.py` to train only the encoder, `train_dec.py` to train the full encoder-decoder network and `train_fine_tune.py` to fine-tune the fully trained model.
Download the datasets and save them in the 'dataset' folder directly.
